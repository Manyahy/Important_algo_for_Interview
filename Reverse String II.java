/*541. Reverse String II

Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= 104*/
class Solution {
    public String reverseStr(String s, int k) {
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
        int n = arr.length;

        for (int start = 0; start < n; start += 2 * k) {
            int i = start;
            int j = Math.min(start + k - 1, n - 1); // reverse only first k chars or remaining

            while (i < j) {
                char temp = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[j];
                arr[j] = temp;
                i++;
                j--;
            }
        }

        return new String(arr);
    }
}
